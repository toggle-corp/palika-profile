# Palika Profile Report Generation

[Cairo](https://cairographics.org/pycairo/)
and
[PyGObject bindings](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)
are required to run the pdf generation library (drafter).

To run the test file:

```bash
# Clone the drafter repo at this location
git clone https://github.com/bibekdahal/drafter

# Run with python (Python version 3 is required)
python test.py
```

A pdf file `test.pdf` is then generated in the project path.
